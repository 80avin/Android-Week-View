Android Week View
=================

**Android Week View** is an Android library for displaying calendar views within an app. It was initially developed by [Raquib-ul Alam](https://github.com/alamkanak), but is not currently maintained and does not work when using API level 28. Therefore, Iâ€™m providing this fork. 

Usage
---------
1. Add the JitPack repository to your project-level build file and the dependency to the app-level build file.
```groovy
// build.gradle (project-level)
allprojects {
 repositories {
  ...
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
 }
}

// build.gradle (app-level)
implementation 'com.github.thellmund:Android-Week-View:1.3' // Bugfix-only version
implementation 'com.github.thellmund:Android-Week-View:3.0' // Version with updated API
```

2. Add `WeekView` in your XML layout.
```xml
<com.alamkanak.weekview.ui.WeekView
    android:id="@+id/weekView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    app:eventTextColor="@color/white"
    app:textSize="12sp"
    app:hourHeight="60dp"
    app:headerColumnPadding="8dp"
    app:headerColumnTextColor="@color/light_blue"
    app:headerRowPadding="12dp"
    app:columnGap="8dp"
    app:noOfVisibleDays="3"
    app:headerRowBackgroundColor="@color/light_gray"
    app:dayBackgroundColor="@color/white"
    app:todayBackgroundColor="@color/light_blue"
    app:headerColumnBackground="@color/white"/>
```

3. Prepare the class of objects that you want to display in `WeekView` by implementing `WeekViewDisplayable<T>`.
```java
public class CalendarItem implements WeekViewDisplayable<CalendarItem> {

    private long id;
    private String title;
    private DateTime startTime;
    private DateTime endTime;
    private String location;
    private int color;
    
    /* ... */
    
    @Override
    public WeekViewEvent<CalendarItem> toWeekViewEvent() {
        // Note: It's important to pass "this" as the last argument to WeekViewEvent's constructor.
        // This way, the EventClickListener can return this object in its onEventClick() method.
        boolean isAllDay = DateUtils.isAllDay(startTime, endTime);
        return new WeekViewEvent<>(
            id, title, startTime.toGregorianCalendar(), 
            endTime.toGregorianCalendar(), location, color, isAllDay, this
        );
    }

}
```

4. Configure `WeekView` in code.
```java
WeekView<CalendarItem> weekView = (WeekView) findViewById(R.id.weekView);
weekView.setOnEventClickListener(new EventClickListener<CalendarItem>() {
    @Override
    public void onEventClick(CalendarItem event, RectF eventRect) {
        // Do something with the CalendarItem
    }
});

// WeekView has infinite horizontal scrolling. Therefore, you need to provide the events 
// of a month whenever that the currently displayed month changes.
weekView.setMonthChangeListener(new MonthLoader.MonthChangeListener<CalendarItem>() {
    @Override
    public List<WeekViewDisplayable<CalendarItem>> onMonthChange(Calendar startDate, Calendar endDate) {
        return mDatabase.getCalendarItemsInRange(startDate, endDate);
    }
});
```

Customization
-------------------

Many aspects of `WeekView` and the individual event chips can be customized.

- `allDayEventHeight`: All-day events are displayed in a header row at the top. This attributes specifies their height. If not set, these events will be set to the height of their content.
- `columnGap`: The horizontal gap between individual days.
- `dayBackgroundColor`: The background color of the current day, e.g. to emphasize it in a multi-day view.
- `eventMarginVertical`: The vertical gap between back-to-back events.
- `eventPadding`: The gap between the event title and the border of its event chip. 
- `eventTextColor`: The color of the event title and location in the event chip.
- `eventTextSize`: The size of text in the event chip.
- `firstDayOfWeek`: The first day of the week. Default is Monday.
- `headerColumnBackground`: The background of the time column which is displayed on the left-hand side.
- `headerColumnPadding`
- `headerColumnTextColor`: The color of the hour text in the time column.
- `headerRowBackgroundColor`: The background color of the header row which runs at the top of `WeekView`.
- `headerRowPadding`: The padding within the header row.
- `hourHeight`: The height with with one hour is displayed. Default is 50dp.
- `hourSeparatorColor`: The color of the horizontal lines that indicate the hours.
- `hourSeparatorHeight`: The height of the horizontal hour lines.
- `noOfVisibleDays`: The number of days that are visible. Default is 3.
- `overlappingEventGap`: The horizontal gap between events that occur concurrently.
- `textSize`: The text size used for text in the time column and the days row, which contains the currently displayed days.
- `todayBackgroundColor`: The background color of the current day.
- `todayHeaderTextColor`: The text color of the current day in the days row.
- `showDistinctPastFutureColor`: Indicates whether distinct background colors should be used for past and future days. Default is false.
- `futureBackgroundColor`: The background color to use for future days. Requires `showDistinctPastFutureColor` to be true.
- `pastBackgroundColor`: The background color to use for past days. Requires `showDistinctPastFutureColor` to be true.
- `showDistinctWeekendColor`: Indicates whether weekends should be marked with a distinct color. Default is false.
- `futureWeekendBackgroundColor`: The background color of future weekend days. Requires `showDistinctWeekendColor` to be true.
- `pastWeekendBackgroundColor`: The background color of past weekend days. Requires `showDistinctWeekendColor` to be true.
- `showNowLine`: Indicates whether a horizontal line should be displayed at the current time. Default is false.
- `nowLineColor`: The color of the now line. 
- `nowLineThickness`: The height of the now line.
- `scrollDuration`: The duration of automatic scrolling. The value determines how fast `WeekView` scrolls to a particular day.

---

Interfaces
-------------------

The following interfaces are used to provide data and interactability to `WeekView`.  
- `setMonthChangeListener()` to provide events to the calendar by months
- `setOnEventClickListener()` to get a callback when an event is clicked
- `setEventLongPressListener()` to get a callback when an event is long pressed
- `setDateTimeInterpreter()` to set your own labels for the calendar header row and header column
- `setWeekViewLoader()` to provide events to the calendar
- `setEmptyViewClickListener()` to get a callback when any empty space is clicked
- `setEmptyViewLongPressListener()` to get a callback when any empty space is long pressed
- `setScrollListener()` to get an event every time the first visible day has changed

Usage
---------

1. Import the library into your project.
  * Grab via maven
  
    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.alamkanak</groupId>
      <artifactId>android-week-view</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.6</version>
      <type>aar</type>
    </dependency>
    ```
  * Grab via gradle
  
    ```groovy
    compile 'com.github.alamkanak:android-week-view:1.2.6'
    ```
2. Add WeekView in your xml layout.

    ```xml
    <com.alamkanak.weekview.ui.WeekView
            android:id="@+id/weekView"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            app:eventTextColor="@android:color/white"
            app:textSize="12sp"
            app:hourHeight="60dp"
            app:headerColumnPadding="8dp"
            app:headerColumnTextColor="#8f000000"
            app:headerRowPadding="12dp"
            app:columnGap="8dp"
            app:noOfVisibleDays="3"
            app:headerRowBackgroundColor="#ffefefef"
            app:dayBackgroundColor="#05000000"
            app:todayBackgroundColor="#1848adff"
            app:headerColumnBackground="#ffffffff"/>
    ```
3. Write the following code in your java file.

    ```java
    // Get a reference for the week view in the layout.
    mWeekView = (WeekView) findViewById(R.id.weekView);

    // Set an action when any event is clicked.
    mWeekView.setOnEventClickListener(mEventClickListener);

    // The week view has infinite scrolling horizontally. We have to provide the events of a
    // month every time the month changes on the week view.
    mWeekView.setMonthChangeListener(mMonthChangeListener);

    // Set long press listener for events.
    mWeekView.setEventLongPressListener(mEventLongPressListener);
    ```
4. Implement `WeekView.MonthChangeListener`, `WeekView.EventClickListener`, `WeekView.EventLongPressListener` according to your need.

5. Provide the events for the `WeekView` in `WeekView.MonthChangeListener.onMonthChange()` callback. Please remember that the calendar pre-loads events of three consecutive months to enable lag-free scrolling.

    ```java
    MonthLoader.MonthChangeListener mMonthChangeListener = new MonthLoader.MonthChangeListener() {
        @Override
        public List<WeekViewEvent> onMonthChange(int newYear, int newMonth) {
            // Populate the week view with some events.
            List<WeekViewEvent> events = getEvents(newYear, newMonth);
            return events;
        }
    };
    ```
