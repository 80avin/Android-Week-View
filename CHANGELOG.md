Changelog
=========

## Version 3.1
*(2018-11-13)*
- Update naming of methods and view attributes. While this unfortunately is another breaking change, the updated naming should be more future-prove.
- Add a customizable bottom line below the header (off by default).
- Add a customizable vertical line between the time column and the events area (off by default).
- Add option `horizontalScrollingEnabled` to completely disable horizontal scrolling. This is helpful for static calendar views that always show a particular time span. 
- Save number of visible days on orientation change, so that it doesnâ€™t go back to the initial value after a device rotation.
